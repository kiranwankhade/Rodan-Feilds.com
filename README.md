# E-Commerce Website using HTML,CSS,Basic Javacript 

The original website is hosted [here](https://www.rodanandfields.com/en-us/). A website to purchase cosmetics products.

## I reproduced this web app and tried to imitate their design and main features. 

On this project I focused on implementing a shopping cart.

###users can:
- Home Page
- Add products to their shopping cart
- Update the quantity, or Remove items
- See the total cost
- by navbar went to anither pages 

The database includes 3 models: Home, Products and Cart,total. When a user add a product to his cart, a new "cart item" will be added
to the Cart. 

## How to run this application locally

```
creating pages of html and give path to respective pages
```

Then run:
```
direct clicking on index file 
```
